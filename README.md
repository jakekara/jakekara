# Hi! 

- 👋 I'm Jake. I'm a software engineer. I work in the Yale Digital Humanities Lab and the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust testimonies. 
- 🧑‍💻 I write all sorts of code, including front-end web apps, backend, and data processing with a dash of machine learning and a pinch of distributed computing on occasion.
- 👨‍🎓 I just finished my master's degree in software engineering 🎉! For my thesis research, I worked on a system to enhance Jupyter Notebooks with annotations called "margin notes." My implementation of margin notes is called Margo, and it's maintained here: [https://github.com/margo-notebooks/](https://github.com/margo-notebooks/)
