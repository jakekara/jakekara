# Hi! 

👋 I'm Jake. I'm a senior software engineer at The Washington Post in Newsroom Engineering. I've worked in data journalism, with a dash of digital humanities for the past decade.

👨‍🎓 I finished my master's degree in software engineering in May 2021 🎉! For my thesis research, I worked on a system to enhance Jupyter Notebooks with annotations called "margin notes." My implementation of margin notes is called Margo, and it's maintained here: [https://github.com/margo-notebooks/](https://github.com/margo-notebooks/)
